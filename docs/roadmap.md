Below is a list of features of Terraform that are currently unsupported and _may_ be implemented in the future.

- ~~Configure providers~~
- ~~Configure the `terraform` block~~
- ~~Declare and set variables~~
- ~~Declare and set outputs~~
- ~~Declare and set locals~~ 
- Support interpolation in strings
- Support comments
- Evaluate expressions and functions
- Support meta-arguments:

## Improvement Ideas
